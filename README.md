# ðŸ“„ Docsbot: 

The core idea behind this project is to create an AI agent that can act as an intelligent documentation assistant. Instead of just relying on the LLM's general knowledge, I want it to be able to **read** specific documentation, reason about the information, and even perform a web search for external data to give you a complete answer.

This also a project to learn how AI can be integrated with applications and other tools and also to solidify my understanding of how to use LLMs effectively.
